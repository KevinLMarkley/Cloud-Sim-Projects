# Cloud-Sim-Projects
Repo where each branch contains slightly modified versions of cloud sim files. Cloud sim is a learning tool meant to simulate current data centers from a low level such as the underlying processors and networking infrastructure to the high level of sending and receiving processing requests.

Assignment 1 contains code that was modified to contain multiple data centers which contain multiple sizes of processors, each with their own memory amounts.

Assignment 3 contains code that was modified from assignment 1 to use a network topology brite file to describe the amount of data centers and how far away from each other and the client request they were.
